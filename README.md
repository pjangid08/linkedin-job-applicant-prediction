## 🧠 Insights
Morning job postings (especially between 8 AM – 11 AM) received the highest first-hour applicant volume
Evening and late-night postings outperformed midday ones, suggesting candidates browse after hours
Day of week had minimal impact, making time of posting the most critical variable
This model can be used by recruiters as a scheduling tool to:
          -Optimize posting times for maximum visibility
          -Boost applicant volume within the first hour
          -Test A/B strategies for role-specific engagement patterns
